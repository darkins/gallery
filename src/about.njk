  <p>Hi, I'm {{ site.author.firstName }} {{ site.author.lastName}}. I'm a novice photography and designer. This website acts as a compendium of images I've taken over the years. If you'd like to learn more about me, try <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">sending me an email</a>.</p>
  <p>This is mock text, write whatever you'd like for the about me page. Maybe add a picture or some of your recent work!</p>
  <p>You can find me around the web at the following places:</p>

  <ul class="about-socials">
    {% for key, value in site.socials %}
      <li><a href="{{ value }}">{{ key | title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

  <h2 id="contact-me">Contact</h2>
