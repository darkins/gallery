STRANDS NOV 20 – DEC 20 2021
Claremorris Art Gallery

STRANDS features sixteen new works by Irish painter, Donald Teskey, mostly created in County Mayo during the summer of 2021.
Teskey has a longstanding connection with North Mayo, beginning with a residency in the
Ballinglen Arts Foundation over twenty-six years ago.
Teskey’s iconic representations of the western seaboard are by now firmly fixed in the canon of
Irish Art. The 5km travel restrictions put Teskey’s planned trip to his beloved Mayo on hold but In
August 2021, Teskey returned to Ballycastle in North Mayo.
The theatrical compositions he created during this residency there depict Teskey’s unmistakable
coastline, its sheets of barren rock and crashing waves with the pull of the Atlantic from sheer cliffs.
In this exhibition, there’s something new in how he conveys the dynamism of this most elemental
landscape.

Rosemarie Noone, owner, Claremorris Gallery notes, “The newness of the landscape to the artist
upon his return after an extended hiatus is reflected in these paintings, his eye perhaps
recalibrated by the isolation of the lockdown.”Speaking about this body of work, Donald Teskey
said, “I brought together a selection of recent paintings which explore themes of landscape,
environment, a sense of place, the new and the familiar all immersed in light and atmosphere and
a love of paint.”

Over the years, Teskey has participated in group shows in Claremorris Gallery but this is his first
solo exhibition in a commercial gallery in the West of Ireland.
